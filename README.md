# Final Year Project: Foodbank Worker Portal (PowerApps Code)

This repository contains the code generated by PowerApps for the Foodbank Worker Portal.
This repo is synced to the PowerApps environment so that when the Foodbank Worker Portal is published, changes are committed to this repo.

I have attached files[FoodbankSolution_1_0_0_10_managed.zip](https://github.com/zcabkle/pa-foodbank-worker-app/files/10996387/FoodbankSolution_1_0_0_10_managed.zip)
 to the exported solution and the exported TestStudio and I have explained how these can be used in further development below.
