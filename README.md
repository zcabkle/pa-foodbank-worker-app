# Final Year Project: Foodbank Worker Portal & Admin Portal Repository

This repository contains the code generated by PowerApps for the Foodbank Worker Portal. <br>

Currently, PowerApps doesn't support creating a GitHub repository for the Admin Portal, so documentation for the Admin Portal will also be in this document. The Admin Portal is included in the solution file provided in this README.md <br>

This repo is synced to the PowerApps environment so that when the Foodbank Worker Portal is published on my environment, changes are committed to this repo. You can set this up by yourself once you have set up this project for local development by following [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/git-version-control).

I have attached the exported solution and the exported Test Studio and I have explained how these can be used in further development below.

## Important Deliverables

## The Foodbank Worker Portal is currently being hosted.

Access the Foodbank Worker App app via [this access link](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/e/68a17071-5a2a-ea91-a8aa-04cacc480e4e/a/4f0c6aef-95ca-48b9-bf7e-f89cbdc97642?tenantId=f932d2dd-377d-4e9b-bc73-5f0efe92533f) on a laptop or (preferably) on a mobile device with the PowerApps app installed.<br>

The PowerApps app can be found on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.msapps&hl=en&gl=US) or on the [App Store](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=powerapps+app&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). If the app is installed on your device, when you click the access link you will be asked whether you would like to launch on the PowerApps app, you should click yes.

## Running Locally

### Side Notes

Both the 'Foodbank Worker Portal' and the 'Admin Portal' parts of the project are under the same solution. By setting up the .zip file for running locally, you will set up both portals in one set of steps!

### Steps to Run Locally

1. If you don't already have a Microsoft Developer account, create one here https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program .<br>
2. Download the .zip file via the "Exported Solution inc. Foodbank Worker Portal on PowerApps and Admin Portal on PowerApps" link in the "Important Deliverables" section.
3. Login to PowerApps, on the top-right corner you should be in the environment that has your name, if not click the current environment to change environment to the one with your name (you want to be in this environment as it is a developer environment).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73954803/225882057-d8f40081-07d9-4f8a-90c5-b6c76da6fdfd.png)
4. Navigate to solutions via the sidebar menu.<br>

5. Choose to import a solution on the top-bar, and upload the .zip file that you downloaded in step 2. Fill any necessary information and make your way through any prompts.
6. The solution will be available in your solutions menu now. Click into the 'Foodbank Solution' to see all of the objects that are part of the solution.
7. You will now be able to run the 'Admin Application' and 'Foodbank Worker App' by clicking into them from the solutions menu.

Click the three dots next the any object and click edit to edit them. This is how you should further develop this project.

## Deployment

### Side Notes
Each time you publish changes to an application on an environment, the changes are accessible to anyone who has been added as a 'User' to the app on that same environment.<br>

Therefore when deploying in PowerApps, assuming users are already part of the current environment, you just need to add the user to the app as a 'User' and make sure they have the correct permissions/security role to use the app. An example of an important permission to have is read access to the Dataverse, if users don't have this then they wont be able to view any of the data displayed in the app!

### Steps for Deployment

**Follow all of the the steps to run locally before trying to deploy**

1. To add a user in the current environment to the app, click the three dot icon and click 'Share'.
2. Find a user with the search bar and assign them an appropriate security role. Fill in the email message if you would like.

3. The user will recieve an email with a link to the app. They will also be able to see and access the app whenever they access PowerApps.
4. You can find the access link to the app under 'Details' and 'Web Link' if you ever need to resend a link to a user already added to the app.

## Testing

### Side Notes

Testing is done with the [PowerApps Test Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/test-studio) which supports testing on canvas apps.

The testing configuration is given in the 'Important Deliverables' section.

### Running the Test Studio

Prerequisites - 
  Download the 'TestStudio Configuration for Foodbank Worker Portal' given in the 'Important Deliverables' section
  Follow the steps to set up the project to run locally.
  Testing in a separate environment to the one you develop in is highly recommended. Learn how to create a new environment here.
